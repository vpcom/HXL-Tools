# HXL Tools

A set of tools for the HXL project(see [project website](https://sites.google.com/site/hxlproject/) and [hxl.humanitarianresponse.info](http://hxl.humanitarianresponse.info) ).

Allows the user:
- to prepare and find help for demos.
- to delete and load any data (requires .ttl data files and the database for the ETL).
- to use many predefined or customizable scripts.
- to get a developer startup guide.

HXL Tools require an authentification and passwords to delete or load to the triple store (not on Github).
